## PRIVACY POLICY
### Last Updated: February 27, 2015

LeChat, Inc. (“**Sameroom**,” “**us**,” and “**we**”) is committed to respecting your privacy. This privacy policy (“**Privacy Policy**”) describes how Sameroom collects, uses and shares personal information of users of our website located at http://sameroom.io (the “**Site**”) and the Services (as defined below). Sameroom provides an online service designed to allow users to connect chat rooms (each a “**Chat**”) from different chat platforms (each a “**Provider**”) (the “**Services**”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites that post different statements.

## WHAT WE COLLECT

We get information about you in a range of ways. 

### Information You Give Us.
- The Services allow users to log in through various Providers.  When you log in to create an account on our network (an “**Account**”), we collect and may store your email address or your Provider authentication token or credentials, as applicable.
- When you post information to a Chat that is initiated through the Services, the information contained in the Chat will be accessible by us and other members of the Chat and members of Chats connected to your Chat will be able to see it.  We collect anonymous statistics regarding the number of messages sent in a Chat connected through the Services.
- When you order products or services on our Site, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping information.
- If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.
- When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional personal information.
- We also collect other types of personal information that you provide to us voluntarily.
- If you participate in a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion, we will collect any data you provide in connection with that promotion.
- We may also collect personal information at other points in our Site that state that personal information is being collected.

**Information Collected via Providers**. By logging in with or connecting with a Provider, you are allowing the Services to access your information and perform certain operations through the Provider on your behalf, and you are agreeing to the Provider’s terms of use in your use of the Services. We may receive information from a Provider and that information may be imported to the Site. Once you log in through or connect with a Provider, you will be able to post information to a Chat via that Provider and that information will be shared with the Provider of any connected Chat. Any information that we collect from a Provider may depend on your Provider’s privacy settings, so please consult the Provider’s privacy and data practices. You can edit access permissions via the Provider, or disable the connection with the Provider by going to your Manage Instruments dashboard here: http://sameroom.io/manage.

**Information We Get From Others**. We may get information about you from other sources. We may add this to information we get from this Site.

**Information Collected via Technology**.

- **Generally**. When you use our Services, some information is automatically collected. For example, when you use our Services, your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“**IP**”) address, domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit are all collected. This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you and administer and improve the Site.

- **Log Files**. We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, including IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to improve the content of the Site, market research purposes, to communicate information to visitors and to better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.

- **Cookies**. We may log information using "Cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.  This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.

- **Analytics**. We use analytics services (including, but not limited to, Google Analytics) to help analyze how users use the Site. Analytics services use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site and we use the information to improve our Site and Services. The analytics services’ ability to use and share information collected by them is restricted by their terms of use and privacy policy, which you should refer to for more information about how these entities use this information, and how you can opt-out of their use of such information.

**Inviting Others to Join**.  You can invite others to join your Chat by sending them a URL acquired through the Services.  When an invitee navigates the URL, we will collect information from the invitee as necessary to connect the invitee’s Chat to your Chat.

We use this anonymous data to enhance the content of our Services and improve the Site. We reserve the right to use anonymous data for any purpose and disclose anonymous data to third parties in our sole discretion.

### SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

**Information You Share**. Our Site and Services allow you to connect and share content and information. Please be mindful of your own privacy needs as you choose who to connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make share.

**Information We Share**. We may disclose aggregated information about our users and information that does not identify any individual without restriction. In addition, we may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide:

- to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it, for any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information, or with your consent;
- to third parties designated by you;
- with our subsidiaries and affiliates;
- with contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business;
- with a Provider if you choose to log in through or connect with a Provider or if you post information to a Chat that is initiated through the Services;
- to a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by us about users is among the assets transferred; and
- to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including responding to any government or regulatory request; to enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us; and/or if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Sameroom, our customers or others.

Once a connection is made between two Chats, Sameroom transmits the information posted in one Chat to the Provider of the other so such information can be seen in the connected Chat(s) (and vice versa).  The information shared will include your name as the person posting the information to the connected Chat.

### INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES

You can request to change contact choices, opt-out of our sharing with others, and review, update, correct, or delete your personal information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
